   abstract = {Candida halophila CBS 4019 (syn. C. versatilis) is an extremely salt-tolerant yeast. It was chosen to study the physiology of long-term resistance to salt stress in cells cultivated at increasing NaCl concentrations up to 4 or 5 M. Growth under stress was slow, severely affected not by salt, but rather by initial external pH. Growing on glucose, glycerol and mannitol were produced. Glycerol is the osmolyte and is transported by H þ /symport. Transport-driven accumulation was though not affected by salt. The role of mannitol is unknown. Internal pH and intracellular volume were constant during growth at all initial pH/salt combinations. H þ-ATPase activity was not affected by salt.},

   abstract = {Objectives To evaluates carbon dioxide (CO2) production from yeast/sugar mixtures and its efficiency as an attractant in BG-Sentinel traps. Methods The rate of CO2 production was optimized for different yeast/sugar mixtures. The optimized mixture was then used as bait in BG-Sentinel traps. The efficiency of this bait was then compared to octenol baited traps. Results The yeast/sugar (5 g: 280 g) in 300 mL water generated the highest volume of CO2. The CO2 baited traps caught significantly more mosquitoes than octenol baited traps. Conclusions Yeast-produced CO2 can effectively replace octenol baits in BG traps. This will significantly reduce costs and allow sustainable mass-application of the CO2 baited traps in large scale surveillance programs.},

   abstract = {<p> <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was grown under aerobic and substrate‐limiting conditions for efficient biomass production. Under these conditions, where the sugar substrate was fed incrementally, the growth pattern of the yeast cells was found to be uniform, as indicated by a constant respiratory quotient during the entire growing period. The effect of carbon dioxide was investigated by replacing portions of the nitrogen in the air stream with carbon dioxide, while maintaining the oxygen content at the normal 20% level, so that identical oxygen transfer rate and atmospheric pressure were maintained for all experiments with different partial pressures of carbon dioxide. Inhibition of yeast growth was negligible below 20% CO <sub>2</sub> in the aeration mixture. Slight inhibition was noted at the 40% CO <sub>2</sub> level and significant inhibition was noted above the 50% CO <sub>2</sub> , level, corresponding to 1.6 × 10 <sup>−2</sup> <italic>M</italic> of dissolved CO <sub>2</sub> in the fermentor broth. High carbon dioxide content in the gas phase also inhibited the fermentation activity of baker's yeast. </p>},
